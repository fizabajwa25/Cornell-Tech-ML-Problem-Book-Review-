Book Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This project uses machine learning to classify book reviews as either positive or negative based on the review text. The goal is to build a model that can generalize well to unseen reviews using text processing and neural network classification techniques.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict whether a book review is positive or not.

Dataset: A labeled dataset of book reviews with binary sentiment (positive or negative).

Approach:

Clean and preprocess the review text.

Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

Train a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluate the model with standard performance metrics.
